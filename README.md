Introduction
-------------
TestON is a solution that aims to interact with OpenFlow/SDN components and automate the functionality of the components.

TestON is an end to end automation solution for testing the Openflow/SDN components.
run across various components in an OpenFlow topology. This solution 
aims to provide an automation framework, that is not just exhaustive in
coverage, but also makes it easy to debug and author scripts. 
It allows for authoring scripts in OpenSpeak (plain English) format and can be run standalone from the command line.


Note:
-----

Please change the params parser file path and Parser name in ~/config/ofa.cfg 



Test Launch

In order to run TestON, you must have:

* A Linux 2.6.26 or greater kernel compiled with network namespace support 
  enabled (see INSTALL for additional information.)

* python 2.6 or higher versions.

* Install python package configObj. It can be installed as :

     openflow@ETH-Tutorial:~$ sudo pip install configObj


* Finally ,launching of test:

* TestON providing two options to launch the test.
 
  1 .Console based :

     * Launching of test must be from "bin" directory which
     
       resides into "TestON-master" directory as following:
       
            paxterra@paxterra-desktop:~/TestON/bin$ ./cli.py 
            teston>run MininetTest 

  2. TAI (Test Authoring Interface) UI based :
      
     * Will provide TAI stand-alone application soon, now user can get the raw code from the TAI directory.
     
  User can launch the test from TAI-UI by clicking the Run Button in tool-bar.
